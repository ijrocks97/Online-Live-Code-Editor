# Online-Live-Code-Editor
In this project i created a web page which allows us to write,edit and run Html , Css and JavaScript code flexiblely.It is simple to use it contains in 
total three textareas each one for html , css and javascript and a separate iframe which is used to display the output of written code.This project helped 
me to understand the basic working od code editor and in future i would like to add some features to make it more reliable and cool.
